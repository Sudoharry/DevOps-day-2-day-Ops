Steps to handle the situation:

STEP-1: Acknowledge the incident:
- Immediately informs the stakeholders about the issue (Team lead, incident management, etc)
- Update the status page or notification system to inform affected users if applicable.

STEP-2:  Check monitoring alerts and logs:
- Review monitoring tools like Prometheus, CloudWatch, or Datadog for alerts.
- Check system logs (e.g var/logs/syslog) for error messages and abnormal activities

STEP-3: Assess the Issue
- Identify whether it's a hardware, network,or application level issue.
- Ping or SSH into the server to determine if it's still reachable.
- Check disk space,CPU,memory usage or application health.

STEP-4: Immediate Mitigation:
- Restart the server or failing services if possible.
- Switch the traffic to a backup server  or instance using load balancers or DNS failover.

STEP-5: Root Cause Analysis:
- Once stability is restored, investigate the root cause of the failure.
- Documentation the incident and resoltions steps

Prevention:

- Implement redundancy (e.g., auto-scaling groups, multi-AZ deployment).
- Use automated monitoring and alerting systems.
- Schedule regular health checks and stress testing.
