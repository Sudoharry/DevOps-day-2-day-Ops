## Overview
This document outlines the steps to diagnose, fix, and prevent high application latency issues. It includes detailed guidelines for identifying latency sources, implementing fixes, and ensuring sustained performance.

## Diagnosis

### 1. Review Monitoring Dashboards
Check response times, request rates, and error rates in tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Datadog**.  
Identify if latency originates from:
- **Frontend**: Slow rendering, large assets.
- **Backend**: API processing delays.
- **Database**: Query performance issues.

### 2. Analyze Logs
Review logs for bottlenecks or errors:
- **Application logs**: Analyze business logic execution times.
- **Access logs**: Identify slow endpoints.
- **Error logs**: Spot exceptions causing delays.

### 3. Check Infrastructure
Analyze server health:
- **CPU**: High usage may indicate inefficient processing.
- **Memory**: Check for leaks or insufficient resources.
- **Disk I/O**: High usage may indicate a bottleneck in read/write operations.
- **Network**: Inspect bandwidth and latency.

Check database query performance using slow query logs or profiling tools.

### 4. Simulate Requests
Use tools like **curl** or **Postman** to simulate API calls and observe response times.  
Perform load testing using:
- **Apache Benchmark (ab)**
- **wrk**

## Fixes

### 1. Caching
- Use in-memory caching systems like **Redis** or **Memcached** for frequently accessed data.
- Enable HTTP response caching with CDNs like **Cloudflare** or **AWS CloudFront**.

### 2. Optimize Code
- Refactor inefficient algorithms.
- Reduce unnecessary computations, loops, or calls to external services.

### 3. Database Tuning
- Optimize slow queries using query analysis tools.
- Create or adjust indexes for faster lookups.
- Implement connection pooling to reduce connection overhead.
- Introduce read replicas for load distribution.

### 4. Scale Resources
- Add compute or memory resources for high-load instances.
- Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to handle demand spikes dynamically.

## Prevention

### 1. Regular Performance Testing
- Perform load and stress tests periodically to identify potential bottlenecks.

### 2. Set Alert Thresholds
Configure monitoring systems to alert for:
- Latency exceeding acceptable limits.
- High CPU or memory usage.
